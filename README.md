My team and I designed and developed an integrated automotive safety system engineered to proactively reduce traffic accidents. The solution utilizes a dual-purpose camera module equipped with advanced computer vision algorithms. This system provides real-time driver monitoring to detect signs of distraction—such as drowsiness or mobile phone use—and simultaneously scans the road ahead to identify hazardous obstacles like potholes. Upon detecting a risk, it triggers an immediate, intuitive alert to warn the driver, thereby enabling quicker reaction times and preventing potential collisions.
